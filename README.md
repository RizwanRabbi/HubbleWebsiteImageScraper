# ESA Hubble Website Image Scraper

A no-fuss tool to grab Hubble images from the ESA website. No more right-click-save nonsense.

It scrapes the highest quality images only from pages that start with `https://esahubble.org/images/`. The images are saved in `.jpg` format, organized by page number, and the script skips any files you‚Äôve already downloaded.

Works well for grabbing galaxies, nebulae, or other catagories they've posted.

## How to Use It

### 1. Requirements

You'll need to install these first:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

---

### 2. Configure the Script

```python
BASE_URL = ""  # Example: "https://esahubble.org/images/archive/category/galaxies/page/"
BASE_DOWNLOAD_DIR = ""  # Example: "hubble_images/galaxes"
START_PAGE = None  # Example: 1
END_PAGE = None    # Example: 10 
```

You can:

- Set stuff up in the script 
- Or run it and fill in when asked

---

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python hubble_image_downloader.py
```

---

## Example Output

```text
[CRAWLING PAGE] https://esahubble.org/images/archive/category/galaxies/page/2/

# If your download isn't working

This script downloads images in `.jpg` format from the Hubble CDN using URLs like:

```
https://cdn.esahubble.org/archives/images/large/{image_id}.jpg
```

If ESA/Hubble ever changes their URL structure, like renaming the `cdn.esahubble.org` domain or moving the image folder path, the script won‚Äôt be able to find the images and downloads will start failing with 404 errors.

So if you're suddenly getting a lot of "Not Found (404)" messages - it's not your internet. It probably means Hubble updated something on their end.

You'd need to:

- Inspect the new URL pattern from the Hubble website manually  
- Update the line in the script that builds the `image_url` (inside the `download_image()` function)
- You can also change the format being downloaded (e.g., `.png`, `.tif`, etc.) by modifying the same URL construction line inside the `download_image()` function. Just make sure that format actually exists on the server - otherwise, you'll still get 404 errors.
